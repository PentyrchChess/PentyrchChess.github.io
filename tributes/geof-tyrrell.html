        school teams respectively in the early 1960s, Geof and I met up again 
        in 1980 as neighbours in Maes-y-Sarn, Pentyrch. The first thing he asked 
        was whether I was still playing chess and I had to say "no, not for 15 
        years or more". The best part of a year later, he gathered some people 
        from the village at his home to test their strength at chess and then 
        launched the club in September 1981 in the lowest division of the East 
        Glamorgan Chess League. We started out playing in St Catwg's Church Hall 
        but after a couple of years we moved to the Kings Arms and we've been 
        there ever since.</td>

        as full of life, great company, warm, friendly and enthusiastic. He had 
        a great wealth of interesting stories and was a real character in Welsh 
        chess, for which he did a huge amount earlier in his career. In the 1970's 
        and early 1980's he had been a non-playing captain of the Welsh Chess 
        Team at several Olympiads and European events and for some years until 
        2008 was President of the Welsh Chess Union. A fulsome tribute from his 
        great friend, Howard Williams (former top board player in the Welsh team), 
        is on the Welsh Chess Union website at</td>
