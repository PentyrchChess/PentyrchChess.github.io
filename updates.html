<h1> Changes to Match Rules - note sections 6(c) and 9(d).</h1>
</p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="5"><strong>EGCA Rules of Play - 
  June 2011</strong></font></p>
<p> EXTRACTS from 'EAST GLAMORGAN CHESS ASSOCIATION RULES OF PLAY FOR LEAGUE MATCHES'</p>
<p> <font size="4"><strong>6. Withdrawals</strong></font></p>
<p> (a) All matches in the league must be played. </p>
<p>(b) A team that fails to fulfill a scheduled fixture will immediately have 
  5 game points deducted. The game will be rescheduled as per the non-offending 
  team�s requirements, bearing in mind 5(c) </p>
<p>(c)<font color="#FF0000"> If a team without prior notice fails to turn up on 
  2 match dates � either as originally scheduled or on a date arranged according 
  to 5(e) - they will be warned that on a third such occasion, they will be immediately 
  withdrawn from the league.</font> If allowed back the following season, they 
  will have to restart in the lowest division. </p>
<p>(d) Where a team is expelled or withdraws from the league, that team's results 
  for the season will be annulled, except where a team has played at least one 
  match against every other team in that division, in which case the result of 
  the first match only against every other team will stand. </p>
<p>(e) Once any game is played in a match, the fixture has been fulfilled.</p>
<p> <font size="4"><strong>9. Default of Games</strong></font></p>
<p> (a) Effect on Counts When a team defaults a board in a match, the opponents 
  must name a player in accordance with 8c on that board to score the game point. 
  The game will not count towards any total required in Rule 8c, but will count 
  towards the number of games a nominated player must play in a season as required 
  in Rule 8(b)(ii). </p>
<p>(b) Clubs should make every effort to ensure that defaults occur on the lowest 
  boards upwards, otherwise penalties will be incurred, subject to the right of 
  appeal. </p>
<p>(c) There is a half hour default time in all matches, after which the game 
  will be awarded to the player present. Until half an hour has elapsed, a captain 
  may use a replacement player who will be subject to the rules and penalties 
  on that board unless agreed with the opposing captain. </p>
<p>(d)<font color="#FF0000"> When team lists are exchanged and all listed players 
  are present then no subsequent changes may be made to personnel or board order, 
  unless the captains agree and the match has not yet started.</font> A captain 
  whose team members are not all present may ask the opposing captain whether 
  certain specified player(s) play on any board(s) allowed by EG grading restrictions, 
  or on the lowest board(s). The opposing captain shall make this decision and 
  the Ex.D. shall be informed of this. In this event no penalty points for infringement 
  of Rule 8d by thespecified player(s) will be applied.</p>
