<p><br>
  Pentyrch Chess Club has donated 5 chess sets and boards to each of the primary
  schools in the community - Pentyrch; Creigiau; and Gwaelod y Garth. This has
  been made possible by the modest but very much appreciated grants from the Pentyrch
  Open Gardens Group (for Pentyrch) and the Welsh Chess Union (for Creigiau and
  Gwaelod y Garth). The Headteachers and pupils of all three schools were very
  grateful recipients of the sets. </p>
<p><br>
  The Club was delighted to be able to pilot this approach in Wales as a means
  of stimulating interest among junior schoolchildren in playing chess. The pictures
  show the enthusiasm with which the sets were received at the schools. We were
  extremely pleased to learn that a chess club is already active in Creigiau Primary
  School, thanks to the initiative of Mr Phillip Ivins. Two pupils from the school
  had recently taken part in a Welsh Chess Union junior competition in Cardiff.
</p>
<p><br>
  If the donated sets help to generate enthusiasm for chess in the schools, further
  visits may be arranged to teach pupils more about the game and give them a chance
  to play against (and, who knows, beat) experienced players from the Club. Perhaps
  in the longer run, all three schools might link up to extend opportunities for
  their pupils to play chess.</p>

  of the East Glamorgan Chess League, can be contacted via the secretary, Mr Vivian
  Martin (tel 029 2089 1402). The Club's website address is www.pentyrchchess.co.uk
